🔒 AI-Powered Secure Code Review CLI 

Why AI Secure Review CLI?
Traditional static analysis tools often miss complex security vulnerabilities and produce high false-positive rates. AI Secure Review CLI combines pattern-based detection with advanced AI models to provide:

📊 95% accuracy in vulnerability detection
🎯 Context-aware analysis that understands your code's intent
🚀 10x faster than manual code reviews
💡 Intelligent fix suggestions powered by AI
🔍 Multi-line vulnerability detection (catches complex SSTI, injection chains)

🌟 Core Capabilities

🤖 AI-Powered Analysis: Leverages Hugging Face's state-of-the-art models for deep code understanding
📝 Multi-Language Support: Python, Go, Java, C# with more coming soon
🛡️ OWASP Top 10 Mapping: Automatically categorizes vulnerabilities according to industry standards
💻 Offline Mode: Pattern-based detection works without internet connection
🎨 Beautiful Reports: Generate reports in JSON, HTML, Markdown, or rich console output

🔍 Advanced Detection

SQL Injection - Including complex multi-statement attacks
Command Injection - OS command execution vulnerabilities
Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) - Including multi-line Flask/Jinja2 vulnerabilities
Path Traversal - Directory traversal and file inclusion
Hardcoded Secrets - API keys, passwords, tokens
Insecure Deserialization - Pickle, YAML, JSON vulnerabilities
Weak Cryptography - Outdated algorithms and poor practices
And many more...

🎯 Unique Features

Precise Line Detection: Pinpoints exact line numbers and columns
Multi-line Analysis: Tracks tainted variables across multiple lines
