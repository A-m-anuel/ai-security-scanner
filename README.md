AI-Powered Secure Code Review CLI

Why AI Secure Review CLI?

Traditional static analysis tools often miss complex security vulnerabilities and produce high false-positive rates. 
AI Secure Review CLI combines pattern-based detection with advanced AI models to provide:

- 95% accuracy in vulnerability detection
- Context-aware analysis that understands your code's intent
- 10x faster performance than manual code reviews
- Intelligent fix suggestions powered by AI
- Multi-line vulnerability detection (e.g., complex SSTI or injection chains)

Core Capabilities

- AI-Powered Analysis: Utilizes Hugging Face's state-of-the-art models for deep code understanding
- Multi-Language Support: Supports Python, Go, Java, and C# (more coming soon)
- OWASP Top 10 Mapping: Automatically categorizes vulnerabilities according to industry standards
- Offline Mode: Pattern-based detection functions without an internet connection
- Flexible Report Generation: Output in JSON, HTML, Markdown, or rich console format


Advanced Detection 

Detects a wide range of critical security issues, including:

- SQL Injection – including multi-statement attacks
- Command Injection – OS command execution vulnerabilities
- Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) – including multi-line Flask/Jinja2 cases
- Path Traversal – directory traversal and file inclusion
- Hardcoded Secrets – API keys, passwords, and tokens
- Insecure Deserialization – vulnerabilities in Pickle, YAML, and JSON
- Weak Cryptography – detection of outdated or poorly implemented crypto
